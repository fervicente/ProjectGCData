### Introduction

---

This documentation corresponds to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Here you can find the data for the project:

### Recipe

---

In order to generate the tidy data set, you must do the following:

1. Download and extract the original data at your working directory under directory './UCI HAR Dataset/'
2. Run the R script 'run_analysis()' in the R shell.
3. The tidy data can be found in the original data directory (point 1) with the name 'tidy.txt'

Enjoy!
